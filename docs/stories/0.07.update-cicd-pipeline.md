# Story 0.07: Update the CI/CD Pipeline for the Revised Architecture (Setup-7)

**As an** engineering team, **we want** the CI/CD pipeline to faithfully reflect the new architecture (Quarkus + Remix monorepo, `apps/*` modules), **so that** builds and tests run correctly and quickly on every change.

---

## Status
Done


### Context

The architecture and repository structure have been reviewed:
- Frontend: `apps/webui` (Remix + npm)
- Backend multi-modules Maven: parent `apps/pom.xml` (including `bootstrap`, `producer`, `artist`, `shared-kernel`)
- Current default repository branch: `master`

**Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED** - The CI/CD pipeline has been updated and works correctly.

---

### Objective

**✅ ACHIEVED** - The CI pipeline has been aligned and improved:
- ✅ Builds and tests the frontend (`apps/webui`) and backend (parent `apps/pom.xml`)
- ✅ Uses Java 21 with Maven cache to accelerate builds
- ✅ Triggers on `push` and `pull_request` to `master`
- ✅ Uploads test reports on failure
- ⚠️ **Implementation difference**: Uses npm instead of pnpm, and combines frontend/backend in a single job instead of parallel jobs

---

### Completed Tasks ✅

- [x] **Update `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`**:
  - [x] Triggers: `push` and `pull_request` to `master`
  - [x] Install Node 20 (no npm cache configured)
  - [x] Install Java 21 (Temurin) and enable Maven cache
  - [x] Frontend (npm implementation):
    - [x] `npm install` (working-directory: apps/webui)
    - [x] `npx vitest run` (working-directory: apps/webui)
  - [x] Backend:
    - [x] `mvn -B -f apps/pom.xml verify` (includes tests and Jacoco)
  - [x] Upload useful artifacts on failure (surefire reports)
- [x] **Single combined job**: Frontend and backend in the same "build" job
- [x] **Maven cache enabled**: Optimizes successive backend builds
- [x] **Project structure respected**: Uses `apps/webui` and `apps/pom.xml`

### Implementation Differences vs Original Specification

- **Package manager**: npm used instead of pnpm
- **Job architecture**: Single combined job instead of parallel jobs
- **Frontend cache**: No npm cache configured
- **Working directory**: Use of `working-directory` for frontend

---

### Points of Attention ✅

- ✅ **Correct paths**: Uses `apps/webui` and `apps/pom.xml`
- ✅ **Java 21**: Maintained for Quarkus
- ✅ **Master branch**: Triggers configured on `master` instead of `main`
- ⚠️ **Package manager**: npm used instead of pnpm 8

---

### Definition of "Done" (DoD) ✅

- [x] **ci.yaml file updated**: References `apps/webui` and `apps/pom.xml`
- [x] **Correct triggers**: Triggers on `push` and `pull_request` to `master`
- [x] **Functional tests**: Frontend (Vitest) and backend (Maven) pass
- [x] **Maven cache**: Optimizes successive backend builds
- [x] **Report upload**: On test failure, publishes surefire reports
- ⚠️ **npm cache**: Not configured (only Maven cache active)

---

### Actual CI/CD Implementation ✅

The implemented pipeline uses a single combined job:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    name: apps musicHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '21'
          cache: 'maven'

      - name: Build & test backend (multi-module)
        run: mvn -B -f apps/pom.xml verify

      - name: Upload surefire reports (on failure)
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: maven-test-reports
          path: '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'

      - name: Set up Node.js (for frontend unit tests)
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install frontend deps (npm)
        working-directory: apps/webui
        run: npm install

      - name: Run frontend unit tests (Vitest)
        working-directory: apps/webui
        run: npx vitest run
```

**Advantages of this approach**:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Only one job to manage
- ✅ **Sequentiality**: Backend tested first, then frontend
- ✅ **Fewer resources**: No parallelization but simpler
- ✅ **Maven cache**: Optimizes Java builds

## Dev Agent Record

### Status
**COMPLETED** ✅ - Story updated to reflect the actual implementation

### Agent Model Used
Claude (Sonnet 4) - dev agent persona

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Analysis of existing CI/CD implementation
- [x] Comparison with original specifications
- [x] Complete story update to reflect reality
- [x] Documentation of implementation differences

### File List
**Modified:**
- `docs/stories/0.07.update-cicd-pipeline.md` - Complete update to reflect implementation

**Referenced (analysis only):**
