# Story 0.02: Generate the Backend Application Skeleton (Setup-2)

**As a** Developer, **I want** the multi-module Maven project for the Quarkus backend to be configured, **so that** the architectural boundaries (domain, application, adapters) are established and enforced from the start.

---

### Tasks to Complete

- [x] In the `apps` folder, create the parent `pom.xml`.
- [x] This parent `pom.xml` must define the following modules: `bootstrap`, `producer`, `artist`.
- [x] For each context module (`producer`, `artist`):
    - [x] Create its parent `pom.xml` (packaging `pom`).
    - [x] Create the sub-modules: `[context]-domain`, `[context]-application`, `[context]-adapters`.
    - [x] Create the `pom.xml` files for each sub-module.
- [x] For each `adapters` module (`producer-adapters`, `artist-adapters`):
    - [x] Create its parent `pom.xml` (packaging `pom`).
    - [x] Create specific adapter sub-modules (e.g., `producer-adapter-rest`, `artist-adapter-persistence`).
    - [x] Create the `pom.xml` files for each adapter.
- [x] Ensure that the directory structure exactly matches the one defined in `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.
- [x] The project must be able to compile via `mvn package` from `apps` without errors (even if it doesn't contain source code yet).

### Definition of "Done" (DoD)

- [x] The directory structure and `pom.xml` files are created in `apps`.
- [x] The `mvn package` command executes successfully from `apps`.
