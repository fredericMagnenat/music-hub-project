# User Story: 0-12 - Performance Baseline Establishment

## Status
Ready

> **As a** Product Owner, **when** we enhance the existing Music Hub system, **I want** established performance baselines and monitoring, **in order to** ensure new functionality doesn't degrade system performance and we can measure impact accurately.

### Pre-requisites
* This story depends on story-0-02 (backend setup) being completed
* Requires access to existing production-like environment for baseline measurement
* Basic monitoring infrastructure should be in place

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Current System Performance Measurement
**Given** the existing Music Hub system is running
**When** baseline performance tests are executed
**Then** we should capture:
- Average response time for existing API endpoints
- Memory usage patterns under normal load
- Database query performance metrics
- System startup time and resource consumption

#### AC2: Performance Monitoring Setup
**Given** performance metrics need continuous tracking
**When** monitoring infrastructure is configured
**Then** it should include:
- Application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- Database performance monitoring
- JVM metrics collection (heap, GC, threads)
- HTTP request/response time tracking

#### AC3: Performance Thresholds Definition
**Given** baseline metrics are established
**When** defining acceptable performance ranges
**Then** alert thresholds should be set for:
- Response time degradation > 20% from baseline
- Memory usage increase > 30% from baseline
- Error rate increase > 2% from baseline
- Database query time > 200% from baseline

#### AC4: Performance Testing Framework
**Given** need for ongoing performance validation
**When** implementing performance testing
**Then** framework should provide:
- Automated performance test suite
- Load testing scenarios for new functionality
- Performance regression test capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance baseline document created with current metrics
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard configured for key performance indicators
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured and tested
- [ ] Performance testing framework implemented
- [ ] Performance regression test suite created
- [ ] Documentation for performance monitoring procedures
- [ ] Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Technical Implementation

#### Monitoring Stack Integration
```yaml
# application.properties additions
quarkus.micrometer.enabled=true
quarkus.micrometer.registry-enabled-default=true
quarkus.micrometer.export.prometheus.enabled=true
```

#### Key Performance Metrics to Track
- **API Endpoints**: Response time, throughput, error rates
- **JVM Metrics**: Heap usage, GC frequency, thread count
- **Database**: Connection pool usage, query execution time
- **External APIs**: Response time, rate limit status

#### Performance Test Scenarios
1. **Baseline Load**: Normal user activity simulation
2. **Spike Load**: Sudden traffic increase simulation
3. **Sustained Load**: Extended period high activity
4. **Integration Load**: External API interaction under load

### Dependencies
- Requires story-0-02 (backend setup) completion
- Should be completed before story-1-02 (external API integration)
- Integrates with story-0-05 (CI/CD pipeline setup)

### Estimated Effort
**3-4 days**

### Priority
**High** - Critical for brownfield system integrity

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance degradation goes unnoticed
- **Mitigation**: Automated alerting and CI integration
- **Risk**: Baseline measurements inaccurate
- **Mitigation**: Multiple measurement cycles and validation
