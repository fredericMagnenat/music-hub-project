# Story 9: Dashboard – Recent Tracks list with status badges

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a Producer,
I want to see the most recent submitted/validated tracks on the Dashboard with a clear status,
so that I can quickly assess activity and track verification progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Recent Tracks" section appears on the Dashboard below the ISRC form.
2. Each item shows: Track Title, Artist Name(s), ISRC, and a visible status badge (`Provisional` or `Verified`).
3. The list supports at least the last 5–10 items.
4. Accessible markup: badges have sufficient color contrast and contain text, list is keyboard navigable.
5. If there are no recent tracks, show an informative empty state.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define in-frontend temporary data source for recent tracks (until backend endpoint exists), or wire to backend if available.
- [ ] Create a reusable `StatusBadge` component with variants `provisional` and `verified`.
- [ ] Render a simple vertical list of up to 10 items on the Dashboard.
- [ ] Add basic responsive styles (stacked on mobile).
- [ ] Update `docs/front-end-spec.md` if the UX microcopy or layout deviates.
- [ ] Commit changes.

## Dev Notes
- Spec alignment: `docs/front-end-spec.md` – Dashboard includes Recent Tracks with badges.
- API: not defined in `docs/architecture/api-specification.md` for listing recents; for now, consider client-side recent submissions cache or add a dedicated story to expose a backend endpoint.
- Styling: use Tailwind + our UI tokens; later, migrate to shadcn components where applicable.

## Testing
- Manual: verify rendering with 0, 1, and 10 items; check color contrast and keyboard navigation.
