# Story 9: Dashboard – Recent Tracks list with status badges

## Status
Done

## Story
As a Producer,
I want to see the most recent submitted/validated tracks on the Dashboard with a clear status,
so that I can quickly assess activity and track verification progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Recent Tracks" section appears on the Dashboard below the ISRC form.
2. Each item shows: Track Title, Artist Name(s), ISRC, and a visible status badge (`Provisional` or `Verified`).
3. The list supports at least the last 5–10 items.
4. Accessible markup: badges have sufficient color contrast and contain text, list is keyboard navigable.
5. If there are no recent tracks, show an informative empty state.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1:** Define temporary data source for recent tracks using localStorage or React state (AC: 1, 3, 5)
  - [x] Create interface for recent tracks data structure
  - [x] Implement client-side storage/retrieval mechanism
  - [x] Handle empty state when no recent tracks exist (AC: 5)
- [x] **Task 2:** Create reusable `StatusBadge` component in `apps/webui/app/components/ui/` (AC: 2, 4)

  - [x] Verify touch accessibility on mobile devices
- [x] **Task 5:** Write component tests using Vitest + React Testing Library
  - [x] Test StatusBadge variants and accessibility
  - [x] Test RecentTracksList with 0, 1, and 10 items scenarios
  - [x] Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- [x] **Task 6:** Commit changes with descriptive commit message

## Dev Notes
- **Spec alignment**: `docs/front-end-spec.md` (lines 37, 109-113) – Dashboard includes Recent Tracks list with status badges as core MVP feature
- **Project structure**: Frontend code in `apps/webui/app/` following Remix patterns
- **Component location**: Create StatusBadge in `apps/webui/app/components/ui/` directory
- **Data source**: Since API endpoint not yet available, implement temporary client-side cache of recent submissions using browser localStorage or React state
- **Styling approach**: Current MVP uses Tailwind CSS (line 42 of spec), shadcn/ui integration planned for future iterations
- **Status badge colors**: Use spec color palette - Success `#10B981` for Verified, Warning `#F59E0B` for Provisional (lines 178-179)
- **Layout**: Vertical card list as specified in wireframe (lines 139-143), responsive stacking on mobile

### Testing
- **Test location**: Co-located with components in `apps/webui/app/` (per unified-project-structure.md lines 72-75)
- **Test framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (line 72 of unified-project-structure.md)
- **Test file naming**: `StatusBadge.test.tsx` alongside `StatusBadge.tsx`
- **Required test scenarios**: 0 items (empty state), 1 item, 10 items, color contrast verification
- **Setup**: Global test setup in `apps/webui/vitest.setup.ts`
