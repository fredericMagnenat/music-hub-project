# User Story: 0-11 - External API Setup Guide

## Status
Ready

> **As a** Developer, **when** I need to integrate with external music APIs, **I want** comprehensive setup documentation and secure credential management, **in order to** ensure smooth development and production deployment without API access blockers.

### Pre-requisites
* This story should be completed before any external API integration stories (story-1-02, story-1-04)
* Access to team lead or project administrator for external service account creation

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Tidal API Setup Documentation
**Given** a developer needs to integrate with Tidal API
**When** they follow the setup guide
**Then** they should be able to:
- Create a Tidal developer account
- Obtain API credentials (API key, client ID/secret)
- Configure development and production environments
- Test basic API connectivity

#### AC2: Spotify API Setup Documentation
**Given** a developer needs to integrate with Spotify Web API
**When** they follow the setup guide  
**Then** they should be able to:
- Register application in Spotify Developer Dashboard
- Configure OAuth2 credentials for appropriate flow
- Set up rate limiting and quota monitoring
- Test API endpoint accessibility

#### AC3: Secure Credential Management
**Given** API credentials are obtained
**When** configuring the application
**Then** credentials should be:
- Stored in environment-specific configuration files (not in code)
- Documented in application.properties templates
- Protected with appropriate access controls
- Rotatable without code changes

#### AC4: Fallback and Error Strategies
**Given** external API dependencies exist
**When** APIs are unavailable or rate-limited
**Then** the system should:
- Implement circuit breaker patterns
- Provide graceful degradation paths
- Log API failures appropriately
- Maintain system functionality for core features

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete setup guide documentation created in `/docs/external-apis/`
- [ ] Environment configuration templates provided
- [ ] Credential rotation procedures documented
- [ ] API testing scripts/procedures documented
- [ ] Circuit breaker implementation guidelines provided
- [ ] Fallback strategy documentation complete

### Technical Notes
- Store API documentation in `/docs/external-apis/tidal-setup.md` and `/docs/external-apis/spotify-setup.md`
- Create environment template files in `/config/templates/`
- Document credential management in existing security documentation
- Ensure alignment with existing Quarkus configuration patterns

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of story-0-01 (monorepo setup)
- Should be completed before story-1-02 (Track integration)

### Estimated Effort
**2-3 days**

### Priority
**High** - Blocks external API integration stories
