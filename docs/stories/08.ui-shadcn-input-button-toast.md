# Story 8: Adopt shadcn-style Input/Button/Toast for ISRC form

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a Producer,
I want a consistent, accessible ISRC input experience using our standard UI components,
so that the UI looks polished and is easy to maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The ISRC input uses a shared `Input` component under `~/components/ui`.
2. The submit button uses a shared `Button` component under `~/components/ui`.
3. Success and error feedback is displayed using a toast mechanism.
4. Inline messaging may remain temporarily, but toast is the primary status feedback.
5. No new runtime dependencies are introduced for this story.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `~/components/ui/Input` with Tailwind styles aligned to spec.
- [x] Create `~/components/ui/Button` with variants and sizes sufficient for MVP.
- [x] Add a lightweight `ToastProvider`, `Toaster`, and `useToast` hook.
- [x] Wrap app layout with `ToastProvider` and render `Toaster`.
- [x] Refactor `app/routes/_index.tsx` to use `Input` and `Button` and trigger toasts on 202/400/422.
- [x] Commit changes.

## Dev Notes
- Tech Stack: Remix + TailwindCSS. `shadcn/ui` planned (docs/architecture/tech-stack.md). For MVP we implemented minimal components without external deps.
- API: `POST /api/v1/producers` returns 202/400/422 (docs/architecture/api-specification.md). UI already targets this endpoint via `registerTrack`.
- File structure: front components live at `apps/webui/app/components/ui/*` consistent with `components.json` alias `ui: "~/components/ui"`.
- Accessibility: inputs maintain `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` attrs; buttons have visible focus ring.

## Testing
- Manual: verify valid/invalid ISRC scenarios; ensure toasts appear/disappear in ~3.2s; keyboard navigation and focus ring present.
- Unit: optional for the toast hook; out of scope for this quick adoption.
