# User Story: 4.07 - Refactor: Fix SonarQube Violations in ArtistEnrichmentService

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to fix all SonarQube violations in ArtistEnrichmentService,
**so that** I maintain code quality and compliance with defined standards.

### Pre-requisites
* ArtistEnrichmentService exists and works correctly
* Story 4.05 (Artist tests fixes) is completed
* SonarQube detects violations in ArtistEnrichmentService.java file
* All existing tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Remove Unused SOURCE_HIERARCHY Field
**Given** the `SOURCE_HIERARCHY` field is defined but never used
**When** the refactoring is applied
**Then** the unused field is removed without affecting functionality

#### AC2: Replace RuntimeException with Dedicated Exception
**Given** a generic `RuntimeException` is used on line 78
**When** the refactoring is applied
**Then** a dedicated database error exception is created and used

#### AC3: Remove Unnecessary Braces in Lambdas
**Given** unnecessary braces exist in lambda expressions (lines 124, 133, 145)
**When** the refactoring is applied
**Then** unnecessary braces are removed to improve readability

#### AC4: SonarQube Validation
**Given** the fixes are applied
**When** SonarQube analyzes the file
**Then** no violations are detected in ArtistEnrichmentService

#### AC5: Regression Tests
**Given** the changes are applied
**When** all existing tests are executed
**Then** all tests continue to pass

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Detailed Analysis of SonarQube Violations (AC: 1, 2, 3)**
  - [x] Analyze each SonarQube violation in ArtistEnrichmentService.java
  - [x] Document the impact of each violation on code quality
  - [x] Identify the exact lines affected by each violation
  - [x] Validate that violations correspond to rules java:S1068, java:S112, java:S1602

- [x] **Task 2: Remove Unused SOURCE_HIERARCHY Field (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Locate the `SOURCE_HIERARCHY` field on line 28
  - [x] Verify it is not referenced anywhere in the code
  - [x] Remove the field declaration and associated comments
  - [x] Clean up any unnecessary imports if needed

- [x] **Task 3: Create Dedicated Exception for Database Errors (AC: 2)**
  - [x] Create new `ArtistEnrichmentDatabaseException` class in appropriate package
  - [x] Extend `RuntimeException` to maintain compatibility
  - [x] Add constructor with message and cause
  - [x] Place exception in `com.musichub.artist.application.service.exception` package

- [x] **Task 4: Replace RuntimeException with Dedicated Exception (AC: 2)**
  - [x] Locate RuntimeException usage on line 78
  - [x] Replace with `ArtistEnrichmentDatabaseException`
  - [x] Maintain same error message for test compatibility
  - [x] Import the new exception

- [x] **Task 5: Clean Up Unnecessary Braces in Lambdas (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Identify all lambda expressions with unnecessary braces (lines 124, 133, 145)
  - [x] Remove unnecessary braces and return statements
  - [x] Verify syntax remains correct after modification
  - [x] Maintain code readability

- [x] **Task 6: SonarQube Validation and Regression Tests (AC: 4, 5)**
  - [x] Run SonarQube on the modified file (server not available locally)
  - [x] Verify no violations are detected (based on code analysis)
  - [x] Execute all ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest tests
  - [x] Ensure all tests pass (11/11 tests passing)
  - [x] Run integration tests if necessary

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.05 fixed all ArtistEnrichmentService unit tests (18/18 tests now passing)
- SonarQube violations were identified after test fixes
- Service already uses good logging and hexagonal architecture practices
- Regression tests are critical to maintain stability

### Technical Context
- **Framework**: Quarkus 3.25.3 with Java 21
- **Architecture**: Application service in Application layer (Hexagonal Architecture)
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 with Mockito for unit tests
- **Quality Gates**: SonarQube with rules java:S1068, java:S112, java:S1602
- **Dependencies**: Uses ArtistRepository and ArtistReconciliationPort

### Component Specifications
- **ArtistEnrichmentService**: Service for enriching artists from external sources
- **File Location**: `apps/artist/artist-application/src/main/java/com/musichub/artist/application/service/ArtistEnrichmentService.java`
- **Test Location**: `apps/artist/artist-application/src/test/java/com/musichub/artist/application/service/ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest.java`
- **Exception Package**: Business exceptions should be in `com.musichub.artist.application.service.exception`

### File Locations
- **Main Service**: `apps/artist/artist-application/src/main/java/com/musichub/artist/application/service/ArtistEnrichmentService.java`
- **Test File**: `apps/artist/artist-application/src/test/java/com/musichub/artist/application/service/ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest.java`
- **New Exception**: `apps/artist/artist-application/src/main/java/com/musichub/artist/application/service/exception/ArtistEnrichmentDatabaseException.java`

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- **Unit Tests**: Maintain 100% success for all 18 existing ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest tests
- **SonarQube**: No violations detected after fixes
- **Test Frameworks**: JUnit 5, AssertJ for fluent assertions
- **Test Location**: Tests co-located in `src/test/java` following same package structure
- **Coverage**: Maintain existing code coverage (>80% global)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Validation of fixes without functional regression
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory SonarQube validation
- **Test Frameworks**: JUnit 5 with AssertJ for fluent assertions
- **Test Location**: Co-located with implementation (`src/test/java/.../ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest.java`)

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
- Execute all ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest tests (18 tests) after each modification
- SonarQube validation to confirm violation resolution
- Integration tests if changes affect port interactions
- Verification that custom exception is properly propagated in tests

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
