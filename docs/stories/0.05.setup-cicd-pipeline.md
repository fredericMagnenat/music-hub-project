# Story 0.05: Implement the Basic CI/CD Pipeline (Setup-5)

**As a** Developer, **I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline to be configured in GitHub Actions that compiles, lints, and tests the code on every push, **so that** code quality and integration health are continuously ensured.

---

## Status
Done


### Tasks to Complete

- [x] In the `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` file, define a workflow that triggers on `push` and `pull_request` to the main branch.
- [x] Define a `build-and-test` job that runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
- [x] Add the following steps to the job:
    - [x] `actions/checkout@v3` to retrieve the code.
    - [x] `actions/setup-java@v3` to configure Java 21.
    - [x] (Optional) `pnpm/action-setup@v2` to configure PNPM if the frontend uses it.
    - [x] (Optional) Install root dependencies: `pnpm install` (if PNPM is used).
    - [x] Build the frontend: `pnpm --filter webui build` (if PNPM/Remix is used).
    - [x] Test the frontend: `pnpm --filter webui test` (if PNPM/Remix is used).
    - [x] Build and test the backend: `mvn -B -f apps/pom.xml package`.
- [x] Push the `ci.yaml` file to the repository.
- [x] Verify in GitHub's "Actions" tab that the pipeline runs and succeeds.

### Definition of "Done" (DoD)

- [x] The `ci.yaml` file is present and correctly configured.
- [x] The pipeline automatically starts on a push.
- [x] All pipeline steps (build and test for both frontend and backend) complete successfully.
