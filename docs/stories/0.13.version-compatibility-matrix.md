# User Story: 0-13 - Version Compatibility Matrix

## Status
Ready

> **As a** Developer and DevOps Engineer, **when** managing dependencies in the brownfield Music Hub system, **I want** a comprehensive version compatibility matrix and upgrade strategy, **in order to** ensure system stability and facilitate safe dependency updates.

### Pre-requisites
* This story depends on story-0-02 (backend setup) and story-0-03 (frontend setup)
* Requires analysis of current dependency versions in the existing system
* Access to current `pom.xml` and `package.json` files

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Current Dependency Analysis
**Given** the existing Music Hub system has established dependencies
**When** dependency analysis is performed
**Then** it should document:
- All current Java/Maven dependency versions
- All current Node.js/npm dependency versions
- Direct vs transitive dependency relationships
- Known compatibility constraints between major components

#### AC2: Version Compatibility Matrix Creation
**Given** current and potential future dependencies are identified
**When** compatibility matrix is created
**Then** it should include:
- Java version compatibility (Current: Java 21)
- Quarkus version compatibility (Current: 3.25.3)
- Node.js/npm version compatibility
- Database version compatibility (PostgreSQL)
- Critical library compatibility constraints

#### AC3: Upgrade Path Documentation
**Given** dependency updates may be needed
**When** upgrade strategy is documented
**Then** it should provide:
- Safe upgrade sequences for major dependencies
- Compatibility testing requirements for updates
- Rollback procedures for failed upgrades
- Breaking change identification process

#### AC4: Dependency Monitoring Setup
**Given** dependencies evolve over time
**When** monitoring system is established
**Then** it should:
- Track security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Monitor for available updates with compatibility info
- Alert on deprecated dependency versions
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for validation

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete dependency inventory documented
- [ ] Version compatibility matrix created and maintained
- [ ] Upgrade path documentation with testing procedures
- [ ] Dependency monitoring system configured
- [ ] Documentation integrated with existing architecture docs
- [ ] Automated dependency checking in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Team training on dependency management procedures

### Technical Implementation

#### Dependency Analysis Tools
```xml
<!-- Maven Dependency Analysis -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>analyze-report</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

#### Version Matrix Structure
```yaml
# version-compatibility-matrix.yml
java:
  current: "21"
  compatible: ["17", "21"]
  planned: "21 LTS"

quarkus:
  current: "3.25.3"
  compatible: ["3.24.x", "3.25.x"]
  upgrade_path: ["3.25.3", "3.26.x", "3.27.x"]
  breaking_changes:
    "3.26.0": ["Config changes", "API updates"]

nodejs:
  current: "18.x"
  compatible: ["18.x", "20.x"]
  npm_compatibility: "9.x"

database:
  postgresql:
    current: "16"
    compatible: ["14", "15", "16"]
    flyway_compatibility: "9.x"
```

#### Compatibility Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Verify functionality with dependency updates
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no performance regression
4. **Security Scans**: Validate security improvements

### Dependencies
- Requires story-0-02 (backend setup) completion
- Requires story-0-03 (frontend setup) completion
- Integrates with story-0-05 (CI/CD pipeline) for automated checking

### Estimated Effort
**2-3 days**

### Priority
**Medium** - Important for long-term maintainability

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Incompatible dependency updates break system
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing matrix and staged rollouts
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies  
- **Mitigation**: Automated monitoring and alerting system
- **Risk**: Complex dependency conflicts during upgrades
- **Mitigation**: Clear upgrade paths and rollback procedures

### Maintenance Strategy
- **Monthly Reviews**: Check for security updates and new versions
- **Quarterly Assessments**: Evaluate major version upgrades
- **Annual Planning**: Plan significant dependency migrations
- **Emergency Procedures**: Handle critical security patches

### Integration with Existing Architecture
- Document version constraints in architecture document
- Integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline checks
- Align with performance baseline monitoring (story-0-12)
- Support rollback strategies defined in Epic documentation
