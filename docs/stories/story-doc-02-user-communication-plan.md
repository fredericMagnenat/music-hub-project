# User Story: DOC-02 - User Communication Plan

## Status  
Ready

> **As a** Product Owner, **when** deploying new functionality to the existing Music Hub system, **I want** a comprehensive user communication strategy, **in order to** ensure smooth user adoption and minimize support overhead.

### Pre-requisites
* This story can run in parallel with development stories
* Requires understanding of user base and current communication channels
* Should align with deployment strategy from story-0-05 (CI/CD pipeline)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: User Impact Assessment
**Given** new functionality is being added to existing system
**When** user impact analysis is performed
**Then** it should identify:
- Users affected by new features (producers, labels, artists)
- Changes to existing workflows (minimal for this brownfield enhancement)
- New capabilities being introduced (ISRC validation, track management)
- Training requirements for new functionality

#### AC2: Communication Strategy Development
**Given** users need to be informed of system changes
**When** communication strategy is created
**Then** it should include:
- Communication timeline aligned with deployment schedule
- Multiple communication channels (email, in-app, documentation)
- Audience segmentation (power users, casual users, administrators)
- Message customization per user segment

#### AC3: Communication Templates Creation
**Given** various communication scenarios need standardized messaging
**When** communication templates are developed
**Then** they should cover:
- Feature announcement templates
- Migration/change notification templates
- Support and FAQ response templates
- Emergency/rollback communication templates

#### AC4: Rollout Communication Plan
**Given** new features will be deployed in phases
**When** rollout communication is planned
**Then** it should address:
- Pre-deployment announcement (feature preview)
- Deployment notification (feature availability)
- Post-deployment follow-up (usage guidance, feedback collection)
- Success metrics and user feedback collection

### Definition of Done
- [ ] User impact assessment document completed
- [ ] Communication strategy document with timelines
- [ ] Communication templates created for all scenarios
- [ ] Rollout communication plan with phase-aligned messaging
- [ ] Support team briefing materials prepared
- [ ] Feedback collection mechanism established
- [ ] Success metrics defined for communication effectiveness

### Communication Strategy Framework

#### Communication Timeline
```
Phase 1 (Pre-Development): Stakeholder notification
Phase 2 (Development): Progress updates for key users
Phase 3 (Pre-Deployment): Feature preview and preparation
Phase 4 (Deployment): Availability announcement
Phase 5 (Post-Deployment): Usage guidance and feedback
```

#### Communication Channels
1. **Email Notifications**: Direct user communication
2. **In-App Announcements**: Contextual feature introductions
3. **Documentation Updates**: Self-service user guides
4. **Support Portal**: FAQ and troubleshooting updates

#### User Segments
- **Primary Users (Producers/Labels)**: Power users needing detailed guidance
- **Secondary Users (Artists)**: Limited access, focused communication
- **System Administrators**: Technical deployment and configuration info
- **Support Team**: Training and troubleshooting materials
