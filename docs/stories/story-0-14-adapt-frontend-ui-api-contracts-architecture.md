### User Story: 0-14 - Adapt Frontend UI to API Contracts and Architecture

## Status
Draft

> **As a** Developer, **when** implementing frontend features, **I want** the entire frontend codebase (`webui`) to be aligned with the final API contracts and frontend architecture, **so that** the UI can correctly consume backend data and is structured for maintainable future development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the refactored backend APIs (from stories 1-03 and 2-02)
   **When** the frontend makes API calls
   **Then** it **must** correctly consume the new API contracts without errors

2. **Given** the new frontend architecture structure
   **When** TypeScript interfaces are needed
   **Then** they **must** be properly organized in `app/types/` directory following the defined conventions

3. **Given** the Producer and Artist API responses
   **When** the UI displays this data
   **Then** it **must** correctly map and render all fields according to the API contracts

4. **Given** the existing frontend functionality
   **When** the adaptation is complete
   **Then** all current features **must** continue to work without regression

5. **Given** the updated frontend architecture
   **When** new components or services are created
   **Then** they **must** follow the established patterns and structure

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Update TypeScript Interfaces (AC: 2)**
  - [ ] Review and update interfaces in `app/types/` to match backend API contracts
  - [ ] Ensure Producer and Artist types align with refactored backend models
  - [ ] Remove any outdated or unused type definitions

- [ ] **Task 2: Update API Service Layer (AC: 1, 3)**
  - [ ] Update Producer API service to consume new backend endpoints
  - [ ] Update Artist API service to consume new backend endpoints  
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for new API responses

- [ ] **Task 3: Update UI Components (AC: 3)**
  - [ ] Update Producer-related components to handle new data structure
  - [ ] Update Artist-related components to handle new data structure
  - [ ] Ensure proper data mapping and rendering

- [ ] **Task 4: Frontend Architecture Compliance (AC: 2, 5)**
  - [ ] Verify all code follows the defined frontend architecture patterns
  - [ ] Ensure proper separation of concerns (types, services, components)
  - [ ] Update any non-compliant code to match architecture standards

- [ ] **Task 5: Testing and Verification (AC: 4)**
  - [ ] Run existing frontend tests to ensure no regressions
  - [ ] Update tests to match new API contracts and data structures
  - [ ] Add integration tests for new API consumption patterns

### Dev Notes

#### Context
This story follows the backend refactoring completed in:
- Story 1-03: Producer context refactoring  
- Story 2-02: Artist context refactoring

The frontend must now be adapted to work with the updated backend APIs and follow the established frontend architecture.
