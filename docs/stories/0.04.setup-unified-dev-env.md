# Story 0.04: Configure the Unified Development Environment (Setup-4)

**As a** Developer, **I want** to be able to run a single command (`quarkus dev`) to start both the backend and frontend with hot reloading, **so that** I can benefit from a smooth and productive development experience.

## Status
Done


### Tasks to Complete

- [x] In the `bootstrap` module's `pom.xml` (`apps/bootstrap/pom.xml`), add the `quarkus-quinoa` dependency.
- [x] In the Quarkus configuration file (`apps/bootstrap/src/main/resources/application.properties`), add the Quinoa configuration:
  ```properties
  # Quinoa UI
  quarkus.quinoa.ui-dir=../webui
  quarkus.quinoa.dev-server.port=5173
  ```
- [x] Run the `mvn quarkus:dev` command from the `apps/bootstrap` directory.
- [x] Verify that the Quarkus backend starts.
- [x] Verify that the Remix development server (frontend) is automatically started by Quarkus.
- [x] Access the frontend URL and verify that the Remix application is served.
- [x] Modify a file in the frontend (`apps/webui`) and verify that hot-reload works in the browser.

### Definition of "Done" (DoD)

- [x] The `quarkus dev` command starts both servers.
- [x] The frontend application is accessible via the Quarkus server URL.
- [x] Hot reloading is functional for both frontend and backend.
