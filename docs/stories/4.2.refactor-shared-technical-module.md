# Story 4.2: Refactor: Créer le module shared-technical et déplacer les utilitaires partagés

---
- **Status**: Done
---

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to refactor shared technical code into a new `shared-technical` module,
**so that** architectural clarity is improved, the domain core is protected from technical concerns, and long-term maintainability is enhanced.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new parent Maven module `apps/shared-technical` with `pom` packaging is created.
2.  A new sub-module `apps/shared-technical/shared-util` is created.
3.  The `CorrelationIdGenerator` class is successfully moved from `shared-kernel` to `shared-util`.
4.  A new sub-module `apps/shared-technical/shared-adapter-spi` is created.
5.  The `TidalAuthClient` class is successfully moved from `producer-adapter-spi` to `shared-adapter-spi`.
6.  All `pom.xml` files for modules like `producer` and `artist` are updated to depend on the new `shared-technical` modules instead of the old locations.
7.  The entire project successfully compiles, and all existing unit and integration tests pass after the refactoring.

## Dev Notes

This story involves a structural refactoring of the Maven modules to better enforce architectural boundaries, as requested by the architect.

### Key Architectural Guidelines

- **Module Structure**: The new structure must align with the principles laid out in the source tree documentation. The goal is to separate purely technical cross-cutting concerns from the shared business domain (Shared Kernel).
  *Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`*

- **Maven Best Practices**: All `pom.xml` modifications must adhere to the project's Maven standards. This includes:
    - Managing new module declarations in the root `apps/pom.xml`.
    - Ensuring new modules that are not runnable applications have the `<quarkus.build.skip>true</quarkus.build.skip>` property.
    - Updating dependencies in consumer modules (`producer`, `artist`, etc.) to point to the new artifacts.
  *Source: `docs/architecture/maven-multi-module-best-practices.md`*

- **Coding Standards**: No business logic should be introduced or modified. This is a pure refactoring of file locations and build descriptors.
  *Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`*

### Previous Story Insights
The previous story (4.1) involved refactoring logging and passing a `correlationId` through the application. The `CorrelationIdGenerator` class, which is part of this refactoring, was identified during that work. This move formalizes its place as a shared *technical* utility rather than a *domain* concept.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create `shared-technical` Parent Module** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create the directory `apps/shared-technical`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create a `pom.xml` in `apps/shared-technical` with `<packaging>pom</packaging>`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add the new module to the `<modules>` section of the root `apps/pom.xml`.

- [x] **Task 2: Create and Populate `shared-util` Module** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create the directory `apps/shared-technical/shared-util`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create the `pom.xml` for `shared-util`, making it a child of `shared-technical`. Add the `<quarkus.build.skip>true</quarkus.build.skip>` property.
    - [x] Subtask 2.3: Move the `CorrelationIdGenerator.java` file and its package structure from `apps/shared-kernel` to `apps/shared-technical/shared-util/src/main/java/...`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.4: Remove the `CorrelationIdGenerator` from the `shared-kernel` module's source.

- [x] **Task 3: Create and Populate `shared-adapter-spi` Module** (AC: 4, 5)
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create the directory `apps/shared-technical/shared-adapter-spi`.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create the `pom.xml` for `shared-adapter-spi`, making it a child of `shared-technical`. Add the `<quarkus.build.skip>true</quarkus.build.skip>` property.
    - [x] Subtask 3.3: Move the `TidalAuthClient.java` file and its package structure from `apps/producer/producer-adapters/producer-adapter-spi` to `apps/shared-technical/shared-adapter-spi/src/main/java/...`.
    - [x] Subtask 3.4: Remove the `TidalAuthClient` from the `producer-adapter-spi` module's source.

- [x] **Task 4: Update Dependencies and Verify** (AC: 6, 7)
    - [x] Subtask 4.1: Identify all modules that previously depended on `shared-kernel` for `CorrelationIdGenerator` and add a new dependency on `shared-util`.
    - [x] Subtask 4.2: Identify all modules that previously depended on `producer-adapter-spi` for `TidalAuthClient` and add a new dependency on `shared-adapter-spi`.
    - [x] Subtask 4.3: Remove the old dependencies if they are no longer needed.
    - [x] Subtask 4.4: Run a full Maven build (`mvn clean install`) from the `apps` directory to ensure the project compiles.
    - [x] Subtask 4.5: Execute all tests (`mvn verify`) to ensure no regressions were introduced.
