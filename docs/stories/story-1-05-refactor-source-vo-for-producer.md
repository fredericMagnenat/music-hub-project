### User Story: 1-05 - Refactor Source Value Object for Cross-Context Reusability

## Status
Done

> **As a** Developer, **I want** to refactor the `Source` Value Object and its related logic out of the Producer context and into the Shared-Kernel, **so that** it can be reused by other bounded contexts (like Artist) and the system benefits from improved type safety and maintainability.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Given** the new `SourceType` enum, **when** it is defined in the `shared-kernel` module, **then** it **must** contain entries for `SPOTIFY`, `TIDAL`, `DEEZER`, `APPLE_MUSIC`, and `MANUAL`.
2.  **Given** the `Source` value object, **when** it is moved to the `shared-kernel` module, **then** it **must** be updated to use the `SourceType` enum and be accessible to both the `producer` and `artist` contexts.
3.  **Given** the `Producer` context, **when** the `Source` refactoring is complete, **then** all its components that previously used `Source` **must** now use the new shared version and compile without errors.
4.  **Given** the introduction of `ProducerSourcePriority`, **when** it is created in the `producer-domain`, **then** it **must** correctly encapsulate the priority logic that was formerly in the `Source` object.
5.  **Given** the completed refactoring, **when** the application is run, **then** all existing tests, especially integration tests for the Producer context, **must** pass, ensuring no regressions in functionality.

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create `SourceType.java` in Shared-Kernel (AC: 1)**
    - [x] In `apps/shared-kernel/src/main/java/com/musichub/shared/domain/values/`, create the `SourceType` enum.
    - [x] Add the required enum constants: `SPOTIFY`, `TIDAL`, `DEEZER`, `APPLE_MUSIC`, `MANUAL`.

- [x] **Task 2: Move and Refactor `Source.java` to Shared-Kernel (AC: 2)**
    - [x] Move `Source.java` from `apps/producer/producer-domain/...` to `apps/shared-kernel/src/main/java/com/musichub/shared/domain/values/`.
    - [x] Update the package declaration to `com.musichub.shared.domain.values`.
    - [x] Modify the `Source` object to use `SourceType` instead of a `String` for the source name.
    - [x] Remove the `priority()` method and any other logic that is specific to the Producer context.

- [x] **Task 3: Create `ProducerSourcePriority.java` in Producer Domain (AC: 4)**
    - [x] In `apps/producer/producer-domain/src/main/java/com/musichub/producer/domain/values/`, create a new class `ProducerSourcePriority`.
    - [x] Implement the priority logic within this class, taking a `Source` or `SourceType` as input and returning its priority value.

- [x] **Task 4: Update Producer Context Dependencies (AC: 3)**
    - [x] Update the `pom.xml` for `producer-domain` and other producer modules to ensure they correctly depend on `shared-kernel`. (Already correct)
    - [x] Update all import statements for `Source` across the main Producer context files to point to the new location in `shared-kernel`.
    - [x] Refactor any code in the Producer context that relied on the old `Source` implementation to use the new shared `Source` and the `ProducerSourcePriority` class.
    - [x] Update remaining test files imports (15 fichiers de test restants)

- [x] **Task 5: Verify and Test (AC: 5)**
    - [x] Create unit tests for the new `SourceType` enum and `ProducerSourcePriority` class.
    - [x] Update existing unit and integration tests in the Producer context that were affected by the change.
    - [x] Run a full build and all tests (`mvn clean install`) for the entire project to ensure no regressions and that all modules compile.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Context
The previous story (`1-04`) successfully fixed a critical persistence mapping for `ArtistCredit`. This current story continues the theme of architectural improvement by refactoring another core value object, `Source`, for better reusability and domain alignment.

#### Architecture Context

**Shared Kernel and Value Objects**
The `shared-kernel` module is the designated location for any domain value objects or event contracts that are used by more than one bounded context. This refactoring aligns directly with this principle.
*   **Rule**: "If a Value Object or event contract is used by more than one bounded context, it **must** be placed in the `apps/shared-kernel` module."
    *   [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - #Enforce-Value-Objects--Shared-Kernel]

**Data Model for `Source`**
The `Source` object is a fundamental part of the application's data model, used in both `Track` and `Artist` aggregates.
```typescript
interface Source {
  sourceName: 'SPOTIFY' | 'TIDAL' | 'DEEZER' | 'APPLE_MUSIC' | 'MANUAL';
  externalId: string;
}
```
*   [Source: `docs/architecture/data-models.md` - #"Track"-&-Dependencies]

**Source of Truth Hierarchy**
The business logic for determining data authority is based on a strict hierarchy. This logic, previously coupled to the `Source` object, will now be managed within each context that needs it (starting with `ProducerSourcePriority`).
*   **Hierarchy**: 1. MANUAL, 2. TIDAL, 3. SPOTIFY, 4. DEEZER, 5. APPLE_MUSIC
    *   [Source: `docs/domain-charter.md` - #6.1.-Source-of-Truth-Hierarchy]

#### File Locations
Based on the project structure, the following files will be created or modified:

*   **CREATE**: `apps/shared-kernel/src/main/java/com/musichub/shared/domain/values/SourceType.java`
*   **MOVE/MODIFY**: `apps/shared-kernel/src/main/java/com/musichub/shared/domain/values/Source.java`
*   **CREATE**: `apps/producer/producer-domain/src/main/java/com/musichub/producer/domain/values/ProducerSourcePriority.java`
*   **MODIFY**: Any files in the `apps/producer/` modules that import or use the `Source` object.
*   **MODIFY**: `pom.xml` files within `apps/producer/` if dependency adjustments are needed.
    *   [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - #Backend-Modules-Structure]

#### Testing
*   New unit tests must be created for `SourceType` and `ProducerSourcePriority`.
*   All tests must follow the established naming conventions and use `@DisplayName`.
*   The overall backend test coverage must remain at or above 80%.
    *   [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-best-practices.md` - #Testing-Philosophy--Principles]
