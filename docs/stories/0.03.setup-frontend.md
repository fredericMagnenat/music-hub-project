# Story 0.03: Initialize the Frontend Application (Setup-3)

**As a** Developer, **I want** the Remix frontend application to be initialized and configured in the monorepo, **so that** I can start integrating UI components.

---

## Status
Done


### Tasks to Complete

- [x] Ensure PNPM is installed globally.
- [x] At the monorepo root, configure `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to recognize the frontend application:
  ```yaml
  packages:
    - 'apps/*'
    - 'packages/*'
  ```
- [x] Create a basic `package.json` in `apps/frontend` (if it wasn't created by the initialization tool).
- [x] Initialize the Remix project in `apps/frontend` with TypeScript support. Use `pnpm create remix@latest`.
- [x] Install test dependencies: `pnpm --filter frontend add -D vitest @testing-library/react`.
- [x] Initialize `shadcn/ui` in the frontend project.
- [x] Verify that the `pnpm --filter frontend dev` command starts the Remix development server without errors.
- [x] Verify that the `pnpm --filter frontend build` command compiles the application without errors.

### Definition of "Done" (DoD)

- [x] The Remix project is functional in `apps/frontend`.
- [x] Dependencies are installed and listed in the application's `package.json`.
- [x] Development and build commands work.
