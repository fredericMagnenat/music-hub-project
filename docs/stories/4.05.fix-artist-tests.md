# User Story: 4.05 - Fix Artist Tests

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** Developer maintaining the Music Hub system,
**I want** to fix all failing unit tests in ArtistEnrichmentService and ArtistService,
**so that** the codebase quality is maintained and artist enrichment functionality works correctly.

### Pre-requisites
* ArtistEnrichmentService and ArtistService implementations exist
* Unit tests are currently failing (17 out of 18 tests in ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest, 6 out of 7 in ArtistServiceTest)
* Understanding of artist enrichment logic and source hierarchy

## Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Fix ArtistEnrichmentService Tests
**Given** 17 failing tests in ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest
**When** the fixes are implemented
**Then** all 18 tests in ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest should pass

#### AC2: Fix ArtistService Tests
**Given** 6 failing tests in ArtistServiceTest
**When** the fixes are implemented
**Then** all 7 tests in ArtistServiceTest should pass

#### AC3: Artist Enrichment Logic
**Given** artist enrichment from external APIs
**When** the enrichment process runs
**Then** the logic should work correctly with proper source hierarchy (MANUAL > TIDAL > SPOTIFY > DEEZER > APPLE_MUSIC)

#### AC4: Artist Status Management
**Given** artists in PROVISIONAL status
**When** enrichment completes successfully
**Then** artists should transition to VERIFIED status

#### AC5: Error Handling
**Given** enrichment failures or API errors
**When** exceptions occur
**Then** they should be properly propagated and handled in tests

#### AC6: Artist Contributions
**Given** multiple artists collaborating on tracks
**When** contributions are processed
**Then** the logic should correctly determine multiple artist contributions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 4.04 (Architecture Coherence Refactoring) is currently blocked by this story
- Recent changes to CDI injection may have affected test mocking
- Artist enrichment logic was recently modified for bug fixes

### Data Models
Current data models from data-models.md:
- Artist: {id, name, status, country?, sources[], contributions[], submissionDate, producerIds[]}
- Status values: PROVISIONAL, VERIFIED, REJECTED
- Sources hierarchy: MANUAL > TIDAL > SPOTIFY > DEEZER > APPLE_MUSIC

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications
No specific API changes required - this is internal logic fixes for existing functionality.

### Component Specifications
- ArtistEnrichmentService: Handles enrichment from external APIs
- ArtistService: Core artist management service
- ArtistReconciliationPort: Interface for artist data reconciliation
- MusicPlatformPort: Interface for external music platform APIs

### File Locations

- Tests: apps/artist/artist-application/src/test/java/com/musichub/artist/application/

### Testing Requirements
From testing-strategy.md:
- Unit tests for domain logic and services using JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ
- Maintain 80% code coverage target with Jacoco
- Use @DisplayName for all test methods
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Avoid unnecessary stubbings that cause UnnecessaryStubbingException

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
From tech-stack.md:
- Java 21 with Quarkus 3.25.3
- CDI for dependency injection
- Mockito for unit test mocking
- JUnit 5 for testing framework

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Validate atomic logic in isolation using JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete flows using H2 in-memory database
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain 80% coverage target with Jacoco
- **Test Documentation**: Use @DisplayName for all test methods
- **Mock Management**: Properly configure Mockito to avoid UnnecessaryStubbingException
- **Test Location**: Co-located with implementation (src/test/java following same package structure)

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
- Fix all existing unit tests without breaking functionality
- Ensure proper mocking of external dependencies
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Validate artist enrichment logic with different source priorities
- Test artist status transitions
- Verify contribution logic for multiple artists
