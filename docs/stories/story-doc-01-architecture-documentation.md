### User Story: DOC-1 - Update Architecture Documentation for Logging Standards

## Status
Completed

> **As an** Architecture Team, **when** new logging standards are implemented in the codebase, **I want** the architecture documentation to reflect current best practices, **in order to** ensure consistency and guidance for future development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the ProducerRepositoryAdapter implements SonarQube-compliant logging patterns
   **When** developers consult the architecture documentation
   **Then** the "Logging Best Practices" section accurately reflects the "log OR rethrow" pattern
   **And** provides clear guidance for each hexagonal architecture layer.

2. **Given** new exception handling patterns are implemented  
   **When** developers need logging guidance
   **Then** the documentation includes concrete code examples for Domain, Application, and Adapter layers
   **And** clearly defines logging responsibilities per layer.

3. **Given** SonarQube compliance requirements
   **When** developers implement exception handling
   **Then** the documentation provides anti-patterns to avoid
   **And** explains the rationale behind the "either log OR rethrow" rule.

4. **Given** MDC correlation patterns are standardized
   **When** developers implement contextual logging
   **Then** the documentation shows proper constant usage
   **And** provides OpenTelemetry integration examples.

### Documentation Tasks

1. **Section Update: "Logging Best Practices"**
   - Replace existing logging guidelines with hexagonal architecture-specific patterns
   - Add comprehensive "Exception Handling & Logging Pattern" subsection
   - Include architecture-specific logging responsibilities table

2. **Code Examples Addition:**
   - Domain layer logging examples (business events only)
   - Application layer examples (log + rethrow pattern)
   - Adapter layer examples (rethrow with context only) 
   - REST layer examples (final error logging + HTTP mapping)

3. **Anti-Pattern Documentation:**
   - Document the log-and-rethrow anti-pattern with explanation
   - Show compliant vs non-compliant code examples
   - Explain multi-threaded application impact

4. **Standards Integration:**
   - Document MDC constant usage (`CORRELATION_ID_KEY`)
   - Update OpenTelemetry correlation examples
   - Include environment-specific configuration

### Technical Implementation Context

This story updates documentation based on these technical implementations:
- `ProducerRepositoryAdapter.java` - Implements compliant logging pattern
- `ProducerPersistenceException.java` - Dedicated exception with contextual information
- SonarQube rule compliance - "Either log exception and handle it, or rethrow it"

### Validation Criteria

#### Documentation Quality
- All code examples compile and follow current patterns
- Logging responsibilities clearly mapped to hexagonal layers
- Anti-patterns clearly explained with business rationale

#### Consistency Check  
- Examples align with actual implemented code
- Standards consistent across all architecture layers
- Integration examples work with current tech stack

#### Usability
- Developers can easily find relevant logging guidance
- Examples are copy-paste ready for implementation
- Clear decision tree for when to log vs rethrow

### Dev Notes

- **Target File**: `docs/architecture.md` - Section "Logging Best Practices"  
- **Reference Implementation**: `ProducerRepositoryAdapter.java` logging patterns
- **Standards**: SonarQube compliance + Hexagonal architecture principles
- **Scope**: Architecture documentation only, no code changes required

### Definition of Done

- [x] "Logging Best Practices" section completely updated
- [x] Code examples for all 4 hexagonal layers included
- [x] Anti-patterns documented with explanations  
- [x] Architecture responsibility table added
- [x] MDC and OpenTelemetry patterns documented
- [ ] Peer review by Tech Lead completed
- [x] Documentation validates against implemented code
