# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Create a **product** to centralize and verify music track catalogues for producers, labels, and artists.
* Provide immediate user value through a minimal interface as part of a PoC (Proof of Concept).
* Validate a Hexagonal and Event-Driven technical architecture to ensure the future maintainability and scalability of the solution.
* Eliminate the manual and time-consuming management of catalogues currently done in Excel files.

## Background Context

Currently, music professionals such as producers, labels, and artists face significant challenges in managing their catalogues. The process is often manual, relying on spreadsheets like Excel, which leads to errors, wasted time, and unreliable data. There is no automated link between a track's metadata (like its ISRC) and its presence on various streaming platforms, forcing tedious manual checks.

This project aims to solve this problem by creating a centralized **product**. The PoC will focus on the most critical functionality identified: allowing a user to add a track via its ISRC code, automatically retrieve metadata from streaming services, and integrate it into their unified catalogue, thus providing an immediate efficiency gain.
