### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Fix ArtistEnrichmentService Tests

**Requirement**: All 18 tests in ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest should pass (currently 17 failing)

  - Then: Returns same artist without calling external APIs

- **Unit Test**: `ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest::shouldEnrichProvisionalArtistWithTidalDataWhenFound`

  - Then: Artist enriched with TIDAL data and status changed to VERIFIED

- **Unit Test**: `ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest::shouldTrySpotifyWhenTidalNotFoundAndFollowHierarchy`
  - Given: Provisional artist, TIDAL not found, Spotify available
  - When: Enrichment service follows source hierarchy
  - Then: Falls back to Spotify and enriches artist

- **Unit Test**: `ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest::shouldReturnOriginalArtistWhenNoExternalSourcesFound`
  - Given: Provisional artist with no external data available
  - When: All external sources return empty
  - Then: Returns original artist unchanged

- **Unit Test**: `ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest::shouldPrioritizeTidalOverSpotifyWhenBothFound`
  - Given: Provisional artist with both TIDAL and Spotify data available
  - When: Enrichment service searches sources
  - Then: Uses TIDAL data (higher priority) and ignores Spotify

### Task Coverage Analysis

#### Task 1: Analyze failing ArtistEnrichmentService tests
**Coverage: PARTIAL** - Tests analyzed but 7 tests missing from implementation

#### Task 2: Fix artist enrichment logic
**Coverage: PARTIAL** - Core logic tested but missing MANUAL/DEEZER/APPLE_MUSIC sources

#### Task 3: Fix error handling in tests
**Coverage: FULL** - Error scenarios well covered

#### Task 4: Analyze failing ArtistService tests
**Coverage: FULL** - All 7 tests implemented and functional

#### Task 5: Fix ArtistService logic
**Coverage: FULL** - Logic fixes implemented in tests

#### Task 6: Run comprehensive tests
**Coverage: FULL** - Both test suites executed

#### Task 7: Code review and cleanup
**Coverage: NONE** - No specific tests for code review process

### Critical Gaps

1. **Missing Tests in ArtistEnrichmentService**
   - **Gap**: Only 11 of 18 tests visible in implementation
   - **Risk**: High - Core functionality may be untested
   - **Action**: Locate or create the 7 missing tests

2. **Incomplete Source Hierarchy Coverage**
   - **Gap**: Only TIDAL/SPOTIFY tested, missing MANUAL/DEEZER/APPLE_MUSIC
   - **Risk**: Medium - Full hierarchy not validated
   - **Action**: Add tests for all source types in hierarchy

3. **Code Coverage Validation**
   - **Gap**: No automated checks for 80% coverage requirement
   - **Risk**: Low - Process requirement, not functional
   - **Action**: Configure JaCoCo coverage gates

4. **Mocking Best Practices**
   - **Gap**: No tests specifically preventing UnnecessaryStubbingException
   - **Risk**: Low - Implementation detail
   - **Action**: Add Mockito configuration validation tests

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis, recommend:

1. **Complete Missing Tests**
   - Implement the 7 missing ArtistEnrichmentService tests
   - Focus on edge cases and error scenarios

2. **Expand Source Hierarchy Tests**
   - Add tests for MANUAL source priority
   - Add tests for DEEZER and APPLE_MUSIC fallback
   - Test full hierarchy chain

3. **Enhance Status Transition Coverage**
   - Add tests for invalid status transitions
   - Test status rollback on enrichment failure

4. **Strengthen Error Handling**
   - Add timeout-specific error tests
   - Test circuit breaker behavior
   - Validate error logging

5. **Improve Mock Management**
   - Add tests for proper Mockito stub cleanup
   - Validate no unnecessary stubbings remain

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Missing 7 ArtistEnrichmentService tests
- **Medium Risk**: Incomplete source hierarchy coverage
- **Low Risk**: Missing code coverage and mocking validations

### Integration with CI/CD

**Recommended Quality Gates:**

- **Unit Test Gate**: All existing tests pass
- **Coverage Gate**: Maintain 80% coverage
- **Traceability Gate**: All ACs have test coverage
- **Mocking Gate**: No UnnecessaryStubbingException

**Automated Checks:**
- Run test suites on every PR
- Block merge if critical tests fail
- Generate coverage reports
- Validate test-to-requirement mapping

This traceability matrix provides a comprehensive view of test coverage for story 4.05. While core functionality is well tested, there are gaps in complete test implementation and source hierarchy coverage that should be addressed to ensure robust artist enrichment functionality.
