# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 4.04 - Architecture Coherence Refactoring

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 7
- Fully Covered: 6 (86%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 1 (14%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Create TrackEnrichmentUseCase and TrackEnrichmentService

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `4.04-UNIT-001` - TrackEnrichmentService processes valid track metadata
  - Given: Valid track metadata requiring enrichment
  - When: TrackEnrichmentService processes the metadata
  - Then: Enrichment is applied correctly without errors

- **Unit Test**: `4.04-UNIT-002` - TrackEnrichmentService handles enrichment errors
  - Given: Invalid or incomplete track metadata
  - When: TrackEnrichmentService attempts processing
  - Then: Appropriate error is thrown and logged

- **Integration Test**: `4.04-INT-001` - TrackEnrichmentService integrates with EnrichmentService
  - Given: TrackEnrichmentService with mocked EnrichmentService
  - When: Service processes track through the full enrichment chain
  - Then: PlatformPort is called correctly and results are returned

#### AC2: Create ArtistEnrichmentUseCase

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `4.04-UNIT-003` - ArtistEnrichmentUseCase processes valid artist data
  - Given: Valid artist data requiring enrichment
  - When: ArtistEnrichmentUseCase processes the data
  - Then: Enrichment is applied correctly

- **Unit Test**: `4.04-UNIT-004` - ArtistEnrichmentUseCase handles missing data gracefully
  - Given: Artist data with missing optional fields
  - When: ArtistEnrichmentUseCase processes incomplete data
  - Then: Enrichment succeeds with defaults or skips optional enrichment

- **Integration Test**: `4.04-INT-002` - ArtistEnrichmentUseCase integrates with reconciliation services
  - Given: ArtistEnrichmentUseCase with mocked reconciliation port
  - When: Service processes artist through enrichment chain
  - Then: Reconciliation is performed and results integrated

#### AC3: Refactor ProducerService

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `4.04-INT-003` - ProducerService uses TrackEnrichmentUseCase for track registration
  - Given: ProducerService with injected TrackEnrichmentUseCase
  - When: Track registration is initiated
  - Then: TrackEnrichmentUseCase is called instead of direct port access

#### AC4: Refactor ArtistService

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `4.04-INT-004` - ArtistService uses ArtistEnrichmentUseCase for artist processing
  - Given: ArtistService with injected ArtistEnrichmentUseCase
  - When: Artist processing is initiated
  - Then: ArtistEnrichmentUseCase is called instead of direct service access

#### AC5: Move business logic to domain entities

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `4.04-UNIT-005` - Domain entities enforce business invariants
  - Given: Domain entities with business logic moved from services
  - When: Entities are created or modified
  - Then: Business rules and invariants are properly enforced

#### AC6: Unit tests for new components

**Coverage: FULL**

Covered by all unit tests defined above for new use cases and services.

#### AC7: Documentation update

**Coverage: NONE**

No automated test coverage - documentation updates are manual processes.

### Critical Gaps

1. **Documentation Validation**
   - Gap: No automated verification of documentation updates
   - Risk: Low - Manual process, but could be forgotten
   - Action: Consider adding documentation validation in CI/CD pipeline

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the refactoring nature of this story:

1. Ensure all existing integration tests still pass after refactoring
2. Add architectural tests using ArchUnit to enforce hexagonal patterns
3. Consider adding performance tests if enrichment operations are time-sensitive
4. Validate that domain immutability is maintained

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - all functional requirements have test coverage
- **Medium Risk**: AC7 documentation - could impact future maintenance
- **Low Risk**: All other requirements have appropriate unit and integration coverage
