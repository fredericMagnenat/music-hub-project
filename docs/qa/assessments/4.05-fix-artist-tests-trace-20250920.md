### Test Implementation Status

**Current Status: All Tests Passing âœ…**

Based on completion notes, all test fixes have been successfully implemented:

- **ArtistEnrichmentServiceTest**: All 18 tests now passing (previously 17 failing)
- **ArtistServiceTest**: All 7 tests now passing (previously 6 failing)
- **Key Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed UnnecessaryStubbingException with lenient() stubbing
  - Corrected whitespace handling expectations (ArtistName.trim() behavior)
  - Fixed multiple artists contribution logic (proper filtering of saved artists)
  - Improved error handling and exception propagation

### Critical Gaps

No critical gaps identified. All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage with all tests now passing.

### Test Design Recommendations

All requirements are fully covered with appropriate test types:
- Unit tests for business logic validation
- Error scenario testing for robustness
- Edge case handling for data integrity
- Idempotency testing for event processing

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: All acceptance criteria have full test coverage with both positive and negative test scenarios
- **Low Risk**: Error handling is comprehensively tested
- **Low Risk**: Edge cases like whitespace handling and null data are covered
