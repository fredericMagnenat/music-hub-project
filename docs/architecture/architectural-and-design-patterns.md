# Architectural and Design Patterns

This project's design is guided by a set of well-established architectural and domain-driven patterns to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

  * **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**: The core application logic (domain and application layers) is isolated from external concerns like databases, APIs, and UI. This is implemented through our Maven multi-module structure (`*-domain`, `*-application`, `*-adapters`).
  * **Event-Driven Architecture**: Bounded Contexts communicate asynchronously via domain events, primarily `TrackWasRegistered`, to reduce coupling and improve resilience.
  * **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Patterns**:
      * **Aggregate**: Used to enforce business rules and consistency within a transactional boundary (e.g., `Producer` aggregate owns `Track` entities).
      * **Repository**: Provides an abstraction for data persistence, allowing the domain to remain independent of the database technology.
      * **Value Object**: Represents concepts defined by their attributes, not their identity, ensuring validity and immutability (e.g., `ISRC` record).
      * **Factory**: Used for the controlled creation of complex objects and aggregates.
