## Database Migration Strategy

### Philosophy

Our database migration strategy follows **Database First** principles with strict version control and automated schema evolution. We use **Flyway** as the single source of truth for all database changes, with Hibernate in **validate-only** mode to ensure consistency.

### Key Principles

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: Flyway migrations are the authoritative schema definition
2.  **Version Controlled**: All schema changes tracked in Git with the application code
3.  **Automated Application**: Migrations run automatically on application startup
4.  **Environment Consistency**: Same migrations across dev/test/production
5.  **Rollback Strategy**: Forward-only migrations with compensating changes
6.  **Bounded Context Isolation**: Each context manages its own schema subset

### Integration with Hibernate
