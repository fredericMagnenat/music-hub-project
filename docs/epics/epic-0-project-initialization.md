# Epic 0: Project Initialization

## Epic Goal

Establish the complete development foundation, including the repository structure (monorepo), the backend and frontend project skeletons, the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and a fully functional local development environment, so that feature development can begin efficiently and on a solid footing.

## Description

This epic represents our project's "Story 0". It delivers no end-user-visible functionality but is an essential prerequisite for all subsequent development. It consists of setting up all the tooling, structures, and processes described in the architecture document.

### Architectural References

*   **Project Structure:** `docs/architecture.md` (section "Unified Project Structure")
*   **Tech Stack:** `docs/architecture.md` (section "Tech Stack")
*   **Local Environment:** `docs/architecture.md` (section "Development and Deployment with Quinoa")
*   **CI/CD:** `docs/architecture.md` (section "CI/CD")

## Stories

1.  **Setup-1: Set Up the Monorepo Structure**
    > **As a** Developer, **I want** the complete monorepo directory structure to be created and pushed to Git, **so that** I have a clear and organized location for all project code and documentation.

2.  **Setup-2: Generate the Backend Application Skeleton**
    > **As a** Developer, **I want** the multi-module Maven project for the Quarkus backend to be configured, **so that** the architectural boundaries (domain, application, adapters) are established and enforced from the start.

3.  **Setup-3: Initialize the Frontend Application**
    > **As a** Developer, **I want** the Remix frontend application to be initialized and configured within the monorepo, **so that** I can begin integrating UI components.

4.  **Setup-4: Configure the Unified Development Environment**
    > **As a** Developer, **I want** to be able to run a single command (`quarkus dev`) to start both the backend and frontend with live-reloading, **so that** I can benefit from a smooth and productive development experience.

5.  **Setup-5: Implement the Basic CI/CD Pipeline**
    > **As a** Developer, **I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline to be configured in GitHub Actions that compiles, lints, and tests the code on every push, **so that** code quality and integration health are continuously ensured.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] The monorepo structure is created and versioned in the Git repository.
- [ ] The `pnpm install` command runs successfully at the project root.
- [ ] The backend project can be compiled successfully (e.g., `mvn package` in the `apps/backend` directory).
- [ ] The frontend project can be compiled successfully (e.g., `pnpm run build` in the `apps/frontend` directory).
- [ ] The `quarkus dev` command correctly starts the unified development environment without errors.
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions is enabled and runs successfully for the project's initial state.
- [ ] The root `README.md` file is updated with basic setup and launch instructions.
